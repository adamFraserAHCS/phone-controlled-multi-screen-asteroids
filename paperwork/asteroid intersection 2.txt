ASTEROID DETECTION ALGORITHM (S)
================================

PART 1 GENERAL BOUNDING BOX
----------------------------
$ create a general bounding box with w & h just enough to fit asteroid
$ if a player interesects this box then switch to part 2 (specific)
$ bounding box.
	+ a general bounding box is much more efficient than
	  lots of specific bounding boxes since they would have
	  to be rendered every frame


PART 2 SPECIFIC BOUNDING BOXES
-------------------------------
$ use some algorithm (TBD) to fit smaller bounding boxes as closely
$ as possible to the asteroid shape then store this configuration with
$ refference to the position of the asteroid
	+ far less intensive (and easier) than an adjacency algo
	+ an adjacency algo would only check at borders potentially
	  creating a safe zone within the asteroid, this method has
	  no such flaw
	
	- due to the asteroids not being cubic shapes there will be
	  a neccesary sacrafice in realism (pollygons seem like an
	  improvement?)
