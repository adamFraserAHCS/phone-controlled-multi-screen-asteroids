Ideas for efficient and accurate asteroid collision detection
===============================================================

DETECTION BY RADIUS RESULTS IN UNACEPTABLE INACCURACY AND ITS SHIT

adjacency detection
	keep a reccord of all the adjacent pixels of an asteroid
	if a player or bolt intersects this region preform some action.

	+v accurate and "realistic" / immersive

	-extremely difficult
	-might not even be an improvement (actually it'd probs be worse)

bounding boxes
	have lots of sufficiently small bounding boxes for it to be fair
	if a player or bolt intersects this box preform some action
	
	+would be really cool to implement
	+lots of room for optimisation
	+simple asteroids would be less demanding
	+once boxes are generated it would be very unintensive

	-would be difficult
	-the algorithm may involve maths you don't have
	-it may be very intensive to generate boxes

radius detection
	simply approximate the asteroid to a circle and detect if the entity
	intersects that circle using simple maths
	
	+super easy
	
	-very unimersive
	-have to do calc for every entity * every asteroid (could be V intensive)
	-not a challange

hybrid system between bounding box and adjaceny detetction.
	draw a box that just fits the asteroid. if the player intersects this box...
	switch over to adjaccency detection

	+would be awesome if it works
	+could be V efficient
	+low intensity when not in bounding box

	-V difficult to build
	-still have to calculate pixel adjacencies
